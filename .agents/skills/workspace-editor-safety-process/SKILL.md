# Workspace Editor Safety Process

## Five-Step Flow
1. Ponder: identify the requested outcome and possible system impact.
2. Analyze: inspect existing code and data before editing.
3. Design: fix scope and method; get approval for broad or destructive changes.
4. Execute: change only the designed scope.
5. Verify: check browser/console or the smallest reliable substitute.

## Data And Git Safety
- Do not flatten folders or move/delete subfolders without explicit user approval.
- Do not delete or overwrite metadata files such as `metadata.json` in each project folder.
- During conflicts, manually merge each project's `metadata.json` `screens` arrays. Never blindly overwrite them.
- Do not push to GitHub `main` unless local verification is complete and the user requested deployment.
- Do not revert user changes. If existing changes affect the task, work with them or ask.

## Code Integrity & Safety Rules
- **Encoding Safety**: Avoid hardcoding raw Korean strings directly inside source code logic to prevent file encoding corruption upon saving. Use ASCII-safe status strings or HTML entities (`&times;` etc.) where applicable, and ensure files are saved in UTF-8.
- **Bracket Matching & Syntax Integrity**: After extensive edits on conditional branches or nested functions, run `check_syntax.ps1` or perform syntax inspection to ensure no missing brackets or trailing syntax errors exist.
- Preserve function declarations, class definitions, global initialization, and module-call names such as `window.updateProperties`.
- In core engine edits, check cross-file function-name consistency before finishing.
- For SVG shapes such as diamonds and triangles, keep `borderColor`, SVG `stroke`, and 1.6px stroke standards synchronized.

## Verification And Reporting
- Define success criteria before editing.
- Report changed files and verification steps after finishing.
- If final verification finds a new SyntaxError, TypeError, or 404, stop and report before continuing.
